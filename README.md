# Crewman

*“A game of pirates, sea monsters, cannons and grog”*

Created by Peter Wells and Stuart Rimel for CS-510 Computer Game Design at Portland State University in the Summer of 2023

## Description

“Crewman” is a game of ship defense where you are a crewman on a ship being attacked by a vicious sea monster. And I'm sure we will have more to say about it later but I just wanted to make a readme.

## Technology

Crewman is created in the open source [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/). Specifically The .Net 4.1.1 version
